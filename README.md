UAV Data Preprocessing is a program that helps pre-processing of GNSS data and aerial photos using the PPK (post-processing kinematic) method for photogrammetry purposes. This program is designed like a flow chart to prepare aerial photo data and photo coordinate pairs before entering the photogrammetry processing by aerial photo processing software such as agisoft.
